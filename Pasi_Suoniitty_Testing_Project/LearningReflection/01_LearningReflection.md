> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
 - It was confusing at first as I've had no previous actual experience in testing. As I moved forward it was interesting and I learned the process of testing and what the different parts of the
    process are.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
 - I used the guidelines and the pre-done example to get started. Then I altered the other pages to describe the possible testing process.
    I viewed the Gitlab pages and imagined the possible tests and issues that may arise or bugs that could be found.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I believe AI can be used to provide some sort of assistance in the process.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
 - I used Visual Studio Code and a simple text editor.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
 - Grasping the whole idea and getting started was probaply the hardest part but once I got the hang of it and started doing the TODOs it went on smoothly.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
 - No trouble luckily. We used Github in a previous learning course of webpage development.
 
      
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
 - Possibly Robot Framework.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
 - Skills with data manipulation of different data formats (XML, CSV, JSON). GUI/API/DB/queues testing.


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
 - Experience with different data types, different databases and different languages. Of course getting more familiar with testing and getting some test projects done would be helpful.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
 - I think I had most trouble with the quizzes at first. The Percipio part was great for learning and the content was excellent even if it required a great investment of time.
